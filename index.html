            <h2>Introduction to a future web developer</h2>
            <p>One of the best things you can do to become a great developer is to find an excellent mentor. A good
                mentor
                will
                provide sound advice on everything from architecture to design, and even how to improve your career
                path.</p>
            <p>
                A person who is not in the same company or location may be the best mentor for you. You can talk to them
                and
                get
                their advice on the phone, via email, or online. A mentor doesn't have to work at your company nor be an
                expert
                developer.</p>

                <h2>If you want to Webdesign </h2>
                <p>Web design and development is an umbrella term that describes the process of creating a website. Like
                    the
                    name suggests, it involves two major skill sets: web design and web development. Web design
                    determines
                    the look and feel of a website, while web development determines how it functions.</p>

                <h1>About Web Development</h1>
                <p>Web development refers in general to the tasks associated with developing websites for hosting via
                    intranet or internet. The web development process includes web design, web content development,
                    client-side/server-side scripting and network security configuration, among other tasks.</p>
