            <h2>Introduction to a future web developer</h2>
            <p>One of the best things you can do to become a great developer is to find an excellent mentor. A good
                mentor
                will
                provide sound advice on everything from architecture to design, and even how to improve your career
                path.</p>
            <p>
                A person who is not in the same company or location may be the best mentor for you. You can talk to them
                and
                get
                their advice on the phone, via email, or online. A mentor doesn't have to work at your company nor be an
                expert
                developer.</p>

                “Stay away from those people who try to disparage your ambitions. Small minds will always do that, but
